`gitlab-ci-mode` is an Emacs major mode for editing [GitLab CI files][].
It provides syntax highlighting and completion for keywords and special
variables.

An interface to the [GitLab CI file linter][] is also provided via
`gitlab-ci-lint`, and also as a [Flycheck][] checker with
``gitlab-ci-mode-flycheck-enable`.
